**Every day over 300 000 people from neighboring countries cross the border to work in Switzerland. Among them are many who contribute substantially to the development of new innovations in Switzerland.**

Cross-border commuters are important for the Swiss economy. This is especially the case in some Swiss regions and the industries that these regions have specialized in. For example, the most recent figures of the <a href = https://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/en/home/statistics/work-income/employment-working-hours/employed-persons/swiss-foreign-nationals/cross-border-commuters.html target = “_blank”> Swiss Federal Statistic Office</a> show that the Lake Geneva region and the region of Northwestern Switzerland together attract almost 200 000 cross-border commuters. As for industries, we can, for example, look at the Swiss pharmaceutical industry – notably the country’s largest exporter. Without taking into account cross-border commuters for this industry, would, for example, clearly over-estimate economic indicators such as labor productivity for (see  <a href = Link Output Dragan target = “_blank”>Title Output Dragan </a>).

In this analysis, we are interested in the role of cross-border commuters for new inventions in Switzerland. Are these workers also substantially contributing to the development of new innovations by Swiss companies? Are there differences across industries in how strongly they rely on cross-border commuting workers? And finally, do existing innovation measures sufficiently reflect the cross-border commuter phenomenon in Switzerland? In what follows, we are taking a closer look at all of these issues.

#### <font color='#68838B'>**How to determine the origin of an invention?**</font>

Every other year, reports such as the <a href = https://www.globalinnovationindex.org/Home target = “_blank”>Global Innovation Index</a>, the <a href = https://www.weforum.org/reports/how-to-end-a-decade-of-lost-productivity-growth target = “_blank”>WEF Global Competitiveness Report</a> or the <a href = https://www.wipo.int/publications/en/series/index.jsp?id=38 target= “_blank”>WIPO World Intellectual Property Report</a> evaluate countries innovative capacities. One measure these studies typically use are patents or patent applications. To be more specific, they look at the number of patents that were filed by inventors of a given country. This is possible because the resident addresses of all the inventors of a patent is always stated on a patent application. You can see this clearly in the example below.

As you can see, this patent has four “Inventors”: Three from Germany and one from France. So, to which country should the invention be attributed?

There are two possibilities to assign patents to countries if we use inventor residence addresses and more than one country is mentioned. The first option is to simply raise the patent count of all the mentioned countries by one. The second approach is to proportionally divide the patent among all mentioned countries according to inventor shares on the patent. In the first case, our example-patent would be equally assigned to Germany and France. In the second case, Germany would get assigned ¾ of the patent and France ¼ of the patent.

However, there is a third option which is to assign patents to countries by using the origin of the firm that owns the patent. Take a look at the “Assignee” right under the “Inventors” on the example-patent. The pro’s and con’s of the different approaches are, for example, briefly discussed in a recent study by <a href = https://www.bertelsmann-stiftung.de/fileadmin/files/user_upload/BST_Weltklassepatente_2020_DT.pdf target = “_blank”>Bertelsmann (2020, p.68)</a>.
